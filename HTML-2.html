        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Ayen! I am 18 years old, and I am from Muntinlupa City. I am currently a freshman at PUP Manila, taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. My personality type is ENTP, and I am the kind of person who loves learning new things every day. I am really excited to learn and grow with everyone here in the web development team, as this tech department inspired me to take the BSIT course. ^___^</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Most of the time, I spend time with my friends, often through games like Mobile Legends and Valorant. I also enjoy learning to play the keyboard, biking, and listening to music. When things feel overwhelming, I turn to ink drawings to clear my mind. On the other hand, when life feels routine or repetitive, I like to challenge myself by learning something new, sometimes even diving into mathematics when I am bored. My hobbies often depend on my mood, and I am currently exploring a few new ones, like practicing volleyball on my own, learning to crochet, and designing pubmats and organizing my Notion workspace.
